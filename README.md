🚕 Ola Ride Booking Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride booking data to uncover key insights about customer behavior, driver performance, booking trends, cancellations, and overall ride efficiency. The analysis is performed using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization.

The goal of this project is to simplify raw data into meaningful insights that help understand important metrics such as ride success rate, average ride distance, cancellation patterns, customer ratings, and revenue generated from successful bookings.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and structure the ride bookings dataset

Build SQL views to answer real-world business questions

Identify top customers, cancellation reasons, and rating patterns

Create interactive Power BI dashboards for visual insights

Track KPIs like:

Successful vs cancelled bookings

Customer churn indicators

Ride distance average per vehicle type

Payment method trends

Revenue from completed rides

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL) – Data cleaning, transformations & analysis

Power BI – Reports, dashboards & trend analysis

Excel / CSV – Dataset handling

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

Booking ID

Customer ID

Vehicle Type

Booking Status

Ride Distance

Booking Value

Driver Ratings

Customer Ratings

Payment Method

Cancellation Reasons

Ride Completion Status

Date

This data allows detailed analysis of customer experience, operational performance, and revenue patterns.

🧠 Key SQL Views Created

The following business questions were solved using SQL (as seen in your project file):

Retrieve all successful bookings

Average ride distance per vehicle type

Total rides cancelled by customers

Top 5 customers with highest bookings

Rides cancelled by drivers due to personal/car issues

Max & min driver ratings for Prime Sedan

UPI payment-based rides

Average customer rating per vehicle type

Total booking value of successful rides

List of incomplete rides with reasons

These views serve as the analytical backbone for the Power BI dashboard.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

KPI cards (Total bookings, cancellations, revenue, churn drivers)

Bar charts (Vehicle type distribution, cancellation analysis)

Line charts (Daily/Monthly booking trend)

Tables (Top 5 customers, incomplete rides)

Rating comparison visuals

The dashboard is designed to be clean, interactive, and business-friendly.

📈 Insights You Can Derive

Prime Sedan and Micro rides contribute the highest booking volume

Customer-based cancellations are more frequent than driver-related ones

UPI is one of the most used payment methods

Incomplete rides highlight operational improvement areas

Loyal customers can be identified for retention strategies

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how raw ride booking data can be transformed into powerful insights using SQL + Power BI. It highlights operational bottlenecks, customer experience metrics, and revenue patterns—making it useful for both data analysts and business decision-makers.
